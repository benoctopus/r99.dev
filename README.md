# r99.dev

Those who follow my activity on github may have noticed the sporatic creation and commits to various repositories linked to my account. All of that activity culminates into this, r99.dev. It, my new portfolio website, will be a collection of work deployed as a kubernetes cluster with some interesting features such as: a custom made reverse proxy, one unified authentication system, wholly scalable infrastructure, and more!

This repository will primarily be a collection of the different sub-modules that make up r99, as well as the tools to build and deploy it.
